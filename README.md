## Overview

These exercises simulate a simple car agency management system using pure JavaScript. The code performs various operations such as fetching agency details, retrieving car models, managing customers, and handling transactions. This project helped reinforce my understanding of JavaScript methods, array manipulations, and object-oriented programming.

## Key Features

- **Agency Management**: Retrieve agency names, IDs, and available cars for sale.
- **Customer Management**: Fetch customer details, cars owned by customers, and manage customer transactions.
- **Data Handling**: Work with arrays and objects to filter, map, reduce, and perform other operations.
- **Method Implementations**:
  - `getAgencyByName(name)`: Fetches an agency object by its name.
  - `getAllCarToBuy()`: Retrieves all cars available for purchase from all agencies.
  - `getCustomerByName(name)`: Retrieves customer details based on the provided name.
  - `getAllCustomersNames()`: Returns an array of all customer names.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core language for writing the exercises, focusing on methods such as `filter()`, `map()`, `reduce()`, and more.
